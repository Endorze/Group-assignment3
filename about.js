//I don't really know how to do it but istead of adding a new div for every person, perhaps we could add the content in JS?

//Idea:

function Person(item, name, text) {
    this.item = item;
    this.name = name;
    this.text = text;
}

let emelie = new Person(teamItem, "Emelie B. Silfverberg", "text");
